    "# Demo of EPIC Distance\n",

    "EPIC distance measures the dissimilarity between reward functions. It works by mapping reward functions to a canonical representative that is invariant to potential shaping, then computing the Pearson correlation between the canonicalized reward functions. In this notebook, we compute EPIC distance between reward functions in a simple PointMass environment.\n",
